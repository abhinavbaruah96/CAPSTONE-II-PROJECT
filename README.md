Context: "Predict behaviour to retain customers. You can analyse all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]
Content: Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.
The data set includes information about:
Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
Inspiration: To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject. Implement different machine learning models to be able to help understand customer features that help in retention.
